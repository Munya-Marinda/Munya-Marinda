As a dedicated and innovative Software Developer with a strong foundation in programming and a passion for problem-solving, I specialize in designing and building scalable, efficient digital solutions. From crafting custom PHP/WordPress software and integrating APIs like Google Maps, OpenAI, and AWS, to automating processes and creating dynamic web and mobile applications, my experience reflects my versatility and ability to adapt to diverse challenges.

Professionally, I’ve contributed to impactful projects such as building content automation systems that leverage AI to rewrite and publish articles, developing analytics plugins to integrate Google Analytics with WordPress, and creating interactive features like geolocation-based car dealership locators. These experiences have sharpened my skills in backend and frontend development, cloud architecture, and data-driven solutions.

Beyond work, I have a deep commitment to personal growth, exemplified by my projects such as publishing apps on the Google Play Store, leading machine learning workshops as part of the TensorFlow User Group Lesotho, and engaging in creative endeavors like graphic design. My technical toolkit spans languages like Python, JavaScript, C#, PHP, and BASH, along with frameworks such as Django, React, and .NET.

With a proactive approach to learning and a proven track record of delivering quality solutions, I thrive on creating meaningful digital experiences. I’m driven by my curiosity, a commitment to excellence, and a belief that technology has the power to transform the way we work and live.
